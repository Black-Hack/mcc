# mcc
mcc is a collection of useful ComputerCraft scripts that automate many boring things

## Install
Run the following command in a computer or a turtle
```
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Black-Hack/mcc/master/update.lua
```
This will automatically install all scripts in the `/mcc` directory.

## Update
To update, run the following command
```
/mcc/update
```
This will automatically remove the previous installation and install the newest version.

**Important: Due to a bug in the update script, you need to run `/mcc/update` twice. This will be fixed soon.**

## Uninstall
To uninstall, remove the `/mcc` directory
```
rm /mcc
```
No need to do any additional cleanup.
